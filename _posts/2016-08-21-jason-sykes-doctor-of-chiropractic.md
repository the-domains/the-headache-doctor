  Hello, Welcome to our headache clinic based in South Kensington. I have been
  in full-time practice since 1996. I treat headache sufferers without the use
  of medications. We are certain we achieve for superior results than the
  conventional medical approach. We feel our success is due to focussing on the
  underlying cause of your headaches, which is usually a structural problem in
  the cervical spine (neck), rather than only trying to block pain pathways with
  strong medications.
